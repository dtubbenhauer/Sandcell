# Sandwich cellularity and a version of cell theory

This page collects all code that is relevant for the calculations in the paper with the name of this section, see [click](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06678) with its home here [click](https://www.dtubbenhauer.com/sandcell.html). We also give a few explanation of how to run the code.

There are three different computer-based calculations that were done in that paper:

* Kazhdanâ€“Lusztig (KL for short) combinatorics of dihedral groups, relevant for Section 2.
* GAP computations of cells, relevant for Section 4.
* Mathematica computation for Gram matrices, relevant for Section 4.

We will discuss all three of these seperately.

Have fun playing with the code!
